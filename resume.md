I work as a software engineer. I am passionate about putting computers to human use, with a single goal: **Improving human life**.

This manifests into many forms like web, mobile, artificial intelligence, voice-interface, and many more. The means of delivery of service is changing everyday, but I believe if we can stick to the goal, we will make progress.

Currently, I work for [Humana, Digital Experience Center](http://humana.io) as a full-stack agile engineer. Please read more about my team here.
