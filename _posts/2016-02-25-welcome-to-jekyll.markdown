Lets talk future.

A future where there are no 3rd party apps. The 'features' that I want are there for grabs (free, or paid). But there's no 'branding' around these features.

## Why no branding?
Because branding gets in the way of me and the feature. For instance, why should I learn that to play a 'related station' for my favorite song, one app shows an overflow menu, while the other wants me to hard-press on the song and then choose 'play related'?

Similar obstacle exists in colors and graphics that the designers use to express brand details.
